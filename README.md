# Green River College Software Development Project Portal

## Summary

This project creates a tool for the faculty of Green River College to more effectivly manage students projects. When the faculty learns about a new project, they need a way to log it and record a description of the project along with the company and client information. Then, once a project is used in class, they need a way to keep track of the URL, login credentials, GitHub repository, and Trello link.

Many projects go through several iterations. So, They also need a way to view a projects history; including what claass it was worked on, who was the teacher, and what changes did they make?
